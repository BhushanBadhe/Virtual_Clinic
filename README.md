Install Docker and docker compose onto your System.

Authenticate and install docker desktop(if you are not familier with docker commands)


Open terminal and hit following commands. 

Step 1: "docker-compose build"
Step 2: "docker-compose up"

Step 3 : http://localhost:8000 for user panel and for admin panel http://localhost:8000/admin.

Note: If you build docker compose then your application credentials will be deleted. Otherwise need to configure volumes on dockerfile and docker-compose file for storing data.
